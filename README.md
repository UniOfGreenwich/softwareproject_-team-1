## Introduction

The library system design and development continues into Phase/2 documenting a list of diagrammatic sections that meticulously breakdown the system architecture into more manageable and understandable pieces whilst keeping both abstraction for the end user and technicality for the any future maintenance:

- **Use Case Diagrams**- show which functions of the system interact with the environment.
- **Sequence Diagrams**- show the actions whilst using the system between the user and system components.
- **Class Diagrams**- show classes and their relationships within the system.
- **State Diagrams**- show the response of the system to any events that occur during runtime.
- **Activity Diagrams** - shows the actions the system takes, rather than the message and information flow of user and system.

This phase also includes updated references and Kanban and a new Gantt chart to display the key milestones for Phase/2 activity until delivery on 23/1/24. Previous tasks from Phase/1 have been labeled accordingly and archived to clear up the confusion between completed and ongoing tasks of Phase/2.

## Overall Architecture of the System
The library system needs many functions specified by the customer to be implemented, for example, inventory searching, fine payment, secure login and rule-sets for both normal and super users. A lot of transactional functions exist whilst a desire for data storage and event processing also exists. The system architecture needs to create an amalgamation of many traditional application types.

**Information systems architecture** allows the developers to employ a storage base for the library information as well as include transactional features such as querying the storage base for information when required. Secure events such as user logins and payments can be adequately processed using encryption within the base and more simple events such as a book search will be effortless. The end user will be able to use a simple but effective UI to easily navigate and operate the application. Overheads for processing and storage can be managed remotely ensuring minimal downtime and costs for the user. Security of both hardware and software can be controlled by the developers during both development and during the maintenance and support period as specified by the customer.

### Activity Diagrams
**Activity **diagrams are behavioral diagrams that describe activity aspects within a system. An activity diagram moves just like a flow chart does, but does so with specific markers used for statements such as: if, switch and while. Other markers can denote the start, stop, parallel activities and swim lanes.

The Activity diagram for this project depicts the process of the program from start to end, featuring all requested functional requirements, such as: a late fee system at 10p per day late, renting only in 3, 7 and 14 day intervals, having a teacher account that can control setup of new accounts and deletion of old accounts, amongst other requirements.

### State Chart Diagrams

## Gantt Chart
Written in the popular app Mermaid for chart creation, this Gantt chart shows the planning for phase 1 of this project and will be fleshed out to show phases 2 and 3 when they have been finalised.

The Gantt chart, Kanban/Table, Introduction, and Glossary are to be drafted by the 23rd of November 2023. This is to allow for clarity in what is completed/to be completed so far within the project and to give a base to other sections of the project, thus boosting the team's confidence via means of a visible road map.

A Gantt chart is well known to be an intuitive, simple, practical and useful visual representation of activities and their associated durations. They are a very widely used tool within industry and are built to focus on 5 main areas.

#### Unidimensional
* One view being 'time', emphasising efficiency.

#### Objective
* Object-oriented.

#### Deterministic
* A Gantt chart determines all that will occur in the project.

#### Analytical and Accountable
* Division of the project allows for smaller bite-sized chunks so resources can be allocated efficiently.

#### Sequential
* After tasks have been completed, then the next task is to be completed, thus sequentially.

A Gantt chart is well known to be an intuitive, simple, practical and useful visual representation of activities and their associated durations. They are a very widely used tool within the industry and are built to focus on 5 main areas. (Geraldi & Lechler, 2012)

## Requirements
### A library system
#### Staff
- Staff all have the same access level.
- Staff can create a user.
- "Staff can delete a user, but a confirmation window will occur when asking to delete a user."
#### Students
- Students will have a lower access level with limited access.
- Students can look at their own account and pay any outstanding balances.
#### Card Payments
- There needs to be a card processing system for payment.
- Payment cannot be stored.
- A validation check is required and keep in mind all credit card numbers depending on vendor have a different starting number.
#### Inventory
- 20 books, at least 3 should be journals.
  - Books require:
    - Titles
    - ISBN number
    - Authors
    - Synopsis - Find one, don't write it.
  - Journals require:
    - Titles
    - Authors
    - DOI number
    - Journal name
    - Conference paper name of the journal name (Seb's words)
#### Storage system of articles
- Must use the Dewey Decimal System.
- Renting
- Books can only be rented in 3, 7, and 14 day intervals at a time.
- Renting starts the same day they take out the article.
- 10p late fee per day late.
#### Data storage
- JSON, XML, CSV, matrix -  any of these to show what each student has taken out (perhaps start all csv/text files with words so that the files can be identified as book logs - Toby idea).
