## Structure of the System Modelling and Design Phase Report

You will need to produce a **markdown** documentation in the form of a report that details the requirements phase of the project.

- ensure that once the project is cloned to your local machine that you checkout to `'phase/2'` and branch off of this to your own branch using the following standard: `'phase/2-gitusername'`. As part of your workflow, you will merge back into `'phase/2'` **ONLY**. 

- **Do not** merge to `main`.

Working as a team you will assign each other tasks to complete phase 1, refer to the required sections for the `README.md` file below.

The requirements phase `README.md` should include the following information:

Structure of the System Modelling and Design Phase Report

The system modelling and design phase report should include the following sections:

- **Introduction** - specifying what diagrams are included in the report and what is their purpose. 

- **Table** - indicating the allocation of tasks to team members.

- The following diagrams (included in the Appendix and not the main body of the report)

- Overall System Archictecture ;
 
   - **Use Case diagrams** - including the tabular representation of the use cases;
 
   - **Sequence diagrams**;
 
   - **Class diagrams**;
 
   - **Activity diagrams**;
 
   - **State chart diagrams**.

   - **An updated Gantt chart of the project plan** â€“ using [Mermaid Gantt Chart Template](https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNpdUD1rwzAQ_SvHzTZYbiZtAdNOntKloOWwrqlILRXlPISQ_55TpRDaQ6DT--Chd8UleUaLR4oiLoKOBPlm2MNbgWAKdMy0VsqT8GvKKwnAh04_z_00Ve7Mi4QU4VDvCu5B6HyC51gyHYyD2fWD0dPBy-CbNCb54vw0WPoUfZMBKBb_N6bJK_hePCEWssU8IsxY3GZsbvofAhbGnccOV9ZvBa9VXIvUoepWdmh19ZRPDl28qY42SYdLXNBK3rjD7aeU0lp6gOyDpDzXan8bvt0BQFBqnQ) at the end of the README.md file under a section called Appendix to be included in the Appendix.
