## Software Process Model

* Project links with waterfall as phases line up with project planning however quite restrictive as changes cannot be made easily with waterfall and lack of engagement with user.
* Agile methods can be changed easily and feedback from our customer on changes or requirements.
* Plan driven sticks to timeline whilst also allowing easier customer changes.
* Incremental development good mix of two. Can stay engaged with customer whilst also keeping to timelines and project phases. Early specification similar to waterfall (page 13 in slides)

 >  ## Incremental development is the process model we have chosen!

## User and System Requirements
